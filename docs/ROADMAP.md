# Roadmap
Our roadmap is where you can learn about what features we are planning to implement, what stage they are in, and when we expect to bring them to you.

## Guide to the roadmap
Here is an overview of our roadmap.

- **General Features**: In this section, we list all the features, that are relevant for the whole Entirety app, for examples, the design style, the user management, etc.

- **Specific Features**: In this section, we sort the features based on the relevant subapps. The planned features for devices processing, for example, will be placed under [Devices App](#devices-app).

Depending on the necessity, difficulty, and our internal capacity, the features are marked as short-term or long-term. For short-term features, we normally already have our hands on it. But we don't have a guarantee on the release date. However, you are always welcome to contact us, if a planned feature is urgently needed by you :)
